A Simple python program with a cute GUI for encryption of images for safe storage and decryption of the same, It uses AES encryption using the pycryptodome module.

For More Info about the Program, you might like to see a blog I created on my website about the same <a href="https://www.quantumrealm.in/computetech/how-encrypt-and-decrypt-images-using-python-and-pycryptodome/">How to encrypt and decrypt images(using AES encryption) in a folder recursively using python.</a>
